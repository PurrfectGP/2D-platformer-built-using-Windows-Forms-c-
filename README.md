# 2D-platformer-built-using-VS-
This is a beta 2D platformer that was built as beta for my A level coursework
I made this code as a deviation from the original coursework as i felt the initial coursework was too beginner level and wanted to make a project that showed my skills in programming.
I use Microsoft Access as my database to store Usernames and Passwords that the program accesses to validate the inputs of the login page and open the Game Menu
I am currently adding a save file system and a profile picture system as you can see in the settings menu
Unfortunately this does not show my full potential due to the limits of windows forms as i can only use pictures for assets and i cannot make an effecient gameplay experience.

I have currently added a gravity system and Keybinds and a boundary system that needs refined. I made the 2D coin animation i myself and when i complete this project i will use my original sprites and assets
